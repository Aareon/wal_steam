wal_steam
=========

A little script that themes the colors for Metro for steam from wal or wpg.

About
-----

Wal is a little program for linux that creates a terminal color scheme based on 
you wallpaper (in addition to being able to set that wallpaper and a few other 
interesting features)

Wpgtk is based on wal, but will the added feature of being able to generate gtk
themes with the colors and bring a nice ui to wal.

This tiny program is meant to work with either of them, by reading the colors 
generated by either program and generating a theme for a really popular skin 
for steam.

Metro for steam looks amazing out of the box, this just makes it so all the 
colors can match everything else on your computer.
